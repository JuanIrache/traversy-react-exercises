Just my projects while I follow [React Front To Back 2019](https://www.udemy.com/modern-react-front-to-back) by Traversy Media.

I might end up doing my own projects instead. We'll see.

- Project 1 deployed [here](https://githubfinder23542352.netlify.com/)
- The rest of the course was applied to real projects, for example the front and back end of [Preguntas Trivia](https://preguntastrivia.com/)
